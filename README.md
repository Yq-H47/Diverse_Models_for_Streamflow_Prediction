# Diverse_Models_for_Streamflow_Prediction
This project provides three solutions for basin runoff prediction modeling, including process-based models, LSTM models, and hybrid models.
## Project Structure
### Core Scripts

1.process-based model.py  
  Purpose: Training a process-based hydrological model for runoff prediction.  
  Key Functionality: Can choose to use the EXP-HYDRO model or the Xinâ€™anjiang model. 
  
2.pure_LSTM.py  
  Purpose: Use the LSTM model to predict runoff, with input including the meteorological forcing data and static attribute data of the basin. 
  Key Functionality: Read data, train model, save model.  
  
3.dPL.py  
  Purpose: Training differentiable hybrid models that couples LSTM and process-based models.  
  Key Functionality: Read data, train model, save model.  
  
4.IN_LSTM.py  
  Purpose: Training alternative hybrid models that couples LSTM and process-based models.
  Key Functionality: Read data, train model, save model.
  
5.dPL_class.py  
  Purpose: Define the EXP-HYDRO model and Xin'anjiang model for hybrid modeling.  
  Key Functionality: Ensures data normalization, feature extraction, and input formatting. 
  
6.cn_class.py  
  Purpose: Define the EXP-HYDRO model and Xin'anjiang model for process-based modeling.  
  Key Functionality: Ensures data normalization, feature extraction, and input formatting. 
  
7.loss.py  
  Purpose: Implements custom loss functions for model optimization.  
  Key Functionality: Supports physics-informed loss terms to enhance prediction accuracy.
